# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple single-page AJAX based Twitter clone.

Presentation is done by HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. The server is handled with Node, Express and AJAX and it incorporates MongoDB to handle the tweet database.

This project was a lot of fun and I hope you have a good experience using it!
